#### Hello everyone my name is Barış and this is my chat app project. As I said this is a chat app built with Nest.js(Node.js framework), Vue.js(Front end javascript framework), Websocket(two way data transfering method), Postgresql(database). I was learning about these technologies and created this project to understand more. There is a guide down below how you can start the project..
# Running the app
## This project can work on docker-compose so you can use docker-compose to run the project or you can manually run apps locally.
### If you go for second option you gonna need a postgres database also you have to configure the .env file.
## For API, go to nest-api folder do this:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
# development
$ npm run start
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## For UI, go to vue-app folder and do:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
# start vue.js ui
$ npm run serve
```
